                <p>As you might know ,there are several types of architecture 
                    all over the world.
                    <br>
                    They are very unique depending on the 
                    region.From South to North,the climates are different and 
                    people have been thinking of the proper style for living.
                    <br>

                    <p>It is said that the primitive-hut is the origin of architecture
                         and its practice.Marc-Antoine Laugier developed the theory.
                         <br>
                         In the theory, he argued for the simplicity of architecture, 
                         that architecture must return to its origins, the simple rustic hut.
                         <br>
                         He thought they should be minimal and we should respect nature.</p>

                        Like log house, earth bag house is build to pile up sand bags.

                        After pilling them up, it’s important to apply mortar on outside
